         More control over the AI'S output
TYPES OF AI PROMPTS:
        1.instruction prompt:
                   You tell the AI exactly what to do. ("eg.: Explain cloud computing in simple words")
        2. question prompt:
                   You ask a questiion.("eg. What is SEO and why is it important?")
        3. Role-Based prompt:

        4. Format-Based prompt:
                   You tell the AI what output format you want.("eg. : write in bullet points")
        5. Rewrite/Improve Prompte:
                   you want to improve something you already worte.("eg. : Rewrite this paragraph to make it more professional.")

        7. Few-Shot prompting(ADVANCED):
                  You show examples and ask AI to follow the pattern
                   EXAMPLE:
                      "Example 1:input-> A, output-> 1"
                       Example 2:input-> B, output-> w
                        now: input->c"
                      AI-> "3"
5 RULES OF WRITING A GOOD AI PROMPT:
         1.Be clear
         2.Add details(more details =better output.)
         3.Set the role
         4.Set the format
